# About
The project is the collection of 4 different ciphers: Affine, Caesar, Hill and Vigenere.
It consists of back-end, front-end and the ciphers part. The idea is to enter the data in a web app and get the encrypted/decrypted result immediately.

The application is built with Python(Flask) and JavaScript(React) which implements all of the following ciphers:
 * [Caesar](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/caesar/)
 * [Affine](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/affine/)
 * [Hill](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/hill/)
 * [Vigenere](http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/classical-era/vigenere-gronsfeld-and-autokey/)
